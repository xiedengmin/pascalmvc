**WARNING: This set of units is still a work-in-progress, and not yet ready for production. Please still [use *mORMot 1.18*](https://github.com/synopse/mORMot) for your projects.**

## Version 2

The *mORMot* framework stayed in revision 1.18 for years, and is was time for a full refactoring.

The main refactoring points tried to better follow SOLID principles:
 - Switch to Semantic Versioning - see https://semver.org
 - Split main big units (`SynCommons.pas`, `mORMot.pas`) into smaller scope-refined units;
 - OS- or compiler- specific code separated to ease evolution;
 - Rename confusing types (e.g. `TSQLRecord` into `TOrm`, `TSQLRest` into `TRest`...);
 - Favor composition over inheritance (e.g. `TRest` class split into proper REST/ORM/SOA classes - and folders);
 - Rewrite some code to avoid internal errors on Delphi (e.g. untyped const/var changed into pointers);
 - Tools to leverage MicroServices coding and administration;
 - Add MVC support for SOA rich clients on Delphi VCL and Lazarus LCL;
 - New features like *OpenSSL*, *libdeflate* or *QuickJS* support;
 - Introduce high-level non-visual `TComponent` version of our classes for a more RAD approach.

We therefore created a whole new project and repository, since switching to version 2 induced some backward uncompatible changes. New unit names were used, to avoid unexpected collision issues during migration, or if 1.18 is to remain installed for a compatibility project.

(See below if you are upgrading from 1.18 branch)

## Compiler targets

## Sub-Folders

The mORMOt 2 repository content is split into the following sub-folders:

- [`src`](src) is the main source code folder, where you should find the actual framework;
- [`packages`](packages) contains IDE packages and tools to setup your dev environment;
- [`static`](static) contains raw library `.o`/`.obj` files needed for FPC and Delphi static linking;
- [`test`](test) defines the regression tests of all framework features;
- [`res`](res) to compile some resources used within `src` - e.g. the `static` third-party binaries;
- [`doc`](doc) holds the documentation of the framework;
- [`ex`](ex) contains various samples.


## Quick Start

*(preliminary instructions)*

1. Clone the https://github.com/synopse/mORMot2 repository, or download a release from https://github.com/synopse/mORMot2/releases

2. Download latest https://synopse.info/files/mormot2static.7z and extract its content to this `/static` sub-folder of the mORMot 2 repository. As an alternative, the file is part of the github releases.

3. Setup your favorite IDE: 

3.1. On Lazarus, just install the `/packages/lazarus/mormot2.lpk` package.

3.2. On Delphi: 
* create new environment variable `mormot2` with full path to the *mORMot 2* sources (Tools - Options - IDE - Evironment Variables); 
* add the following string to your IDE library paths (for all target platforms):

   `$(mormot2)\src\core;$(mormot2)\src\db;$(mormot2)\src\rest;$(mormot2)\src\crypt;$(mormot2)\src\script;$(mormot2)\src\app;$(mormot2)\src\net;$(mormot2)\src\orm;$(mormot2)\src\soa;$(mormot2)\src\lib`

4. Open and compile `/test/mormot2tests.dpr` in the IDE, and run the regression tests on your machine.

5. Browse the [examples folder](/ex) (still a work in progress).

5. Discover and Enjoy!


## Presentation

Synopse *mORMot* is an Open Source Client-Server ORM SOA MVC framework for Delphi 7 up to Delphi 11 Alexandria and FPC 3.2/trunk, targeting Windows/Linux for servers, and any platform for clients (including mobile or AJAX).

The main features of *mORMot* are therefore:

 - ORM/ODM: objects persistence on almost any database (SQL or NoSQL);
 - SOA: organize your business logic into REST services;
 - Clients: consume your data or services from any platform, via ORM/SOA APIs;
 - Web MVC: publish your ORM/SOA process as responsive Web Applications.

With local or remote access, via an convention-over-configuration Client-Server REST design.

Due to its modular design, switch from a Client-Server architecture over HTTP, named pipes or GDI messages into a stand-alone application is just a matter of *mORMot* classes initialization.
For instance, the very same executable can even be running stand-alone, as a server, as a service, or a client, depending on some run-time parameters!

Emphasizing speed and versatility, *mORMot* is a incredibly well documented Open Source project easy enough to add basic ORM or Client-Server features to simple applications for hobbyists, or let experienced users develop scaling and strong service-based projects for their customers, with the advantages of native code and easy-to-deploy solutions, reducing deployment cost and increasing ROI.

## Domain-Driven-Design Ready

It provides an Open Source self-sufficient set of units (even Delphi starter edition is enough) for creating any application, from a stand-alone solution up to the most complex Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

- Presentation layer featuring MVC UI generation with i18n and reporting (with pdf export) for rich Delphi clients, MVC web clients (with logic-less Mustache templates) or rich AJAX clients (via native JSON/REST access);

- Application layer implementing Service Oriented Architecture via interface-based services (like WCF) and Client-Server ORM (including method-based services) - following a RESTful model using JSON over several communication protocols (e.g. HTTP/1.1);

- Domain Model layer handling all the needed business logic in plain Delphi objects, including high-level managed types like dynamic arrays or records for Value Objects, dedicated classes for Entities or Aggregates, and variant storage with late-binding for dynamic documents;

- Data persistence infrastructure layer with ORM operations on direct Oracle, MS SQL, OleDB, ODBC, ZEOS/ZDBC access or any TDataSet provider (e.g. FireDAC/AnyDAC, UniDAC, NexusDB, BDE...), with a powerful SQLite3 kernel, and optional SQL access if needed, with amazing performance and advanced features like Array DML, auto-generating SQL for SQLite3, Oracle, 
 Jet/MSAccess, MS SQL, Firebird, DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL and NexusDB - and alternative high-speed MongoDB NoSQL database access for ODM persistence;

- Cross-Cutting infrastructure layers for handling data filtering and validation, security (e.g. Windows authentication or any custom model), caching, logging and testing (framework uses test-driven approach and features interface stubbing and mocking).

## Client-Server Fully Integrated Framework

With *mORMot*, ORM/ODM is not used only for data persistence of objects (like in other implementations), but as part of a global n-Tier, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), ready to implement Domain-Driven solutions. This framework is not an ORM on which a transmission layer has been added, like almost everything existing in Delphi, C# or Java: this is a full Client-Server ORM/SOA from the ground up. This really makes the difference.

The business logic of your applications will be easily exposed as Services, and will be accessible from light clients (written in Delphi or any other mean, including AJAX).

The SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine has been integrated on the server side and can be used to define business rules or any process (including MVC web rendering) - just like node.js, but with a multi-threaded core, and the full power of our optimized Delphi libraries at hand.

The framework Core is non-visual: you will get everything you need in a consistent set of classes to be used from code. In order to let you focus on your business, using *mORMot*'s KISS/DRY/SOC/YAGNI/TDD and Convention-Over-Configuration patterns. But you have also some UI units available (including screen auto-generation, reporting and ribbon GUI), and you can use it from
any RAD, web, or AJAX clients (via JavaScript or Smart Mobile Studio).

No dependency is needed on the client side (no DB driver, or third-party runtime): it is able to connect via standard HTTP, even through a corporate proxy or a VPN. Rich Delphi clients can be deployed just by copying and running a stand-alone small executable, with no installation process. Stream can be encrypted via HTTS or with proven SHA/AES-256. Endpoints are configured automatically for each published interface on both server and client sides, and creating a load-balancing proxy is a matter of one method call.

Speed and scalability has been implemented from the ground up: a genuine optimized multi-threaded core let a single server handle more than 50,000 concurrent clients, faster than DataSnap, WCF or node.js, and our rich SOA design is able to implement both vertical and horizontal scalable hosting, using recognized enterprise-level SQL or NoSQL databases for storage.

Even if *mORMot* will be more easily used in a project designed from scratch, it fits very well the purpose of evolving any existing Delphi project, or creating the server side part of an AJAX application.

## Units

Some units (e.g. `...`) are used by *mORMot*, but do not require the whole framework to be linked.

That is, you can use e.g. only  PDF generation, SynDB fast database access, a static-linked SQLite3 engine, direct MongoDB access, Mustache templates, SpiderMonkey JavaSCript engine, code-generated reports, or the TDocVariant, TDynArray, TSynLog classes of SynCommons, without using the main *mORMot* units and features (ORM, Client-Server, services, UI).

## Upgrading From 1.18 Revision

Quick Steps when upgrading from a previous 1.18 revision:

1) Note all units where split and renamed, and some breaking changes introduced for enhanced features, therefore a direct update is not possible - nor wanted

2) Switch to a new folder, e.g. #\lib2 instead of #\lib

3) Download latest 2.# revision files as stated just above
  
4) Change your references to *mORMot* units:
 - All unit names changed, to avoid collision between versions.
 
5) Consult the documentation about breaking changes from 1.18, mainly:
 - Units refactoring (see point 4 above);
 - Delphi 5-6 and Kylix compatibility removed;
 - BigTable, LVCL, RTTI-UI deprecated;
