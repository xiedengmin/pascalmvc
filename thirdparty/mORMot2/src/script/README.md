# mORMot Scripting Units

## Folder Content

This folder hosts the Scripting Units of the *mORMot* Open Source framework, version 2.

## Scripting

It is a modern and convenient way to add scripting to your applications, e.g. to allow user-defined workflows in the application or presentation layer, on both client or server sides.

Our *mORMot* allows scripting on client or server side, using several engines. We tried to leverage the scripting engines use, so that you may be able to embed the right engine for the right need.

The framework currently supports:
- [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) as a small, stand-alone but complete JavaScript interpreter - perfect for client side execution;
- [SpiderMonkey](https://mozilla-spidermonkey.github.io/) as JavaScript interpreter and JIT - could be used on production for high-end services.
