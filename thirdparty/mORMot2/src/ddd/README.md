# mORMot Domain-Driven-Design / Kingdom-Driven-Design Units

## Folder Content

This folder hosts the *Domain/Kingdom-Driven-Design* high-level features of the *mORMot* Open Source framework, version 2.

## Domain-Driven-Design and Kingdom-Driven-Design

Domain-Driven-Design (DDD) is a set of paranoid architecture and design rules for writing highly-maintainable applications.

Kingdom-Driven-Design (KDD) is our own definition of a less paranoid set of design rules, leveraging the *mORMot* framework abstractions, like ORM or SOA.
