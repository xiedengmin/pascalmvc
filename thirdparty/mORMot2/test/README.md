# mORMot Test Files

## Folder Content

This folder holds the regression tests defined for the *mORMot* Open Source framework, version 2.

## MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 three-license

The framework source code is licensed under a disjunctive three-license giving the user the choice of one of the three following sets of free software/open source licensing terms:
- *Mozilla Public License*, version 1.1 or later (MPL);
- *GNU General Public License*, version 2.0 or later (GPL);
- *GNU Lesser General Public License*, version 2.1 or later (LGPL), with *linking exception* of the *FPC modified LGPL*.
This allows the use of our code in as wide a variety of software projects as possible, while still maintaining copy-left on code we wrote.

See [the full licensing terms](../LICENCE.md) in the root folder of this repository for more information.

## Testing Policy

Framework code is tested against code correctness via unit tests, to avoid behavior or performance regressions, and ease refactoring. We try to have the best code coverage possible, and avoid any unexpected problem when upgrading the firmware.
